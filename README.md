# Udemy-Clone-Vanilla
This is my first project for ***bld.ai*** summer internship's front-end course, and it's a simulation for ***Udemy***'s home page.

The project is completed.
I used **HTML5** and **CSS** in building the structure and applying some basic styles, **Vanilla JavaScript** to fetch courses data from an API, manipulate search bar form, creating courses cards, and applying media queries to carousel, and I finally used **Bootstrap** in styling cards and layout them using Bootstrap grid system, and creating the carousel.

Phases that the project passed by:
- Phase #1:
  - Creating basic structure using semantic HTML
  - Applying basic styling using CSS
  - Building reponsive design using flex box and media queries
- Phase #2:
  - Using JavaScript to fetch the data of the courses from an API
  - Using JavaScript to process the search bar form and apply filters on the courses
  - Using JavaScript to edit elements using DOM manipulation functions
- Phase #3:
  - Using Bootstrap built in components to build the courses carousel
  - Using Bootstrap grid to layout courses in the carousel
  - Using Bootstrap to style cards and courses in the carousel
