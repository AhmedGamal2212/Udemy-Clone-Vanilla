# bld.ai-project-1
This is my first project for ***bld.ai*** summer internship's front-end course, and it's a simulation for ***Udemy***'s home page.

The project is now in **Phase #2** of development.
I have already worked on the structure and basic styles of the page using ***HTML5*** & ***CSS3***. Also, I am applying here what I newly learn, so it will be under development as long as I learn new front-end stuff. 

Currently, I'm working on:

- Refactoring some parts of the code to provide better looking responsive page.
- Adding scripts to fetch the course data from an API and render it using JS.
- Making the Search Bar usable in filtering the courses during writing parts of the name of the course.

You can find the **live demo** of the current version here https://ahmedgamal2212.github.io/bld.ai-project-1/.
