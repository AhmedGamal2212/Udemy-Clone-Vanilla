# bld.ai-project-1
This is my first project for ***bld.ai*** summer internship's front-end course, and it's a simulation for ***Udemy***'s home page.

The project is completed.
I have already worked on the structure and basic styles of the page using ***HTML5*** & ***CSS3***. Also, I am applying here what I newly learn, so it will be under development as long as I learn new front-end stuff. 

Phases that the project passed by:
- Phase #1:
  - Creating basic structure using semantic HTML
  - Applying basic styling using CSS
  - Building reponsive design using flex box and media queries
- Phase #2:
  - Using JavaScript to fetch the data of the courses from an API
  - Using JavaScript to process the search bar form and apply filters on the courses
  - Using JavaScript to edit elements using DOM manipulation functions
- Phase #3:
  - Using Bootstrap built in components to build the courses carousel
  - Using Bootstrap grid to layout courses in the carousel
  - Using Bootstrap to style cards and courses in the carousel

You can find the **live demo** of the final version here https://ahmedgamal2212.github.io/bld.ai-project-1/.
